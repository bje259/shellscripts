1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
EXPUNSIVE

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,840
Kyaa!

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,560
So...so goooood...

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,300
Ah! Ah! It's nice!

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,960
Feels good!

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
By75

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
I can't fall over here!

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,900
How can this happen?

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,460
Don't throw me away!

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,840
Now here I am!

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,820
I beg you!

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,340
I've got nothing to do with it,

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,340
I can't take it anymore.

14
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,340
Ah! Ah! Ah!

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:33,340
I'm sleeping! I have a lot of things to do!

16
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:43,340
The End

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,340
When did I get into this room?

18
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,340
Good morning!

19
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,340
Mikuru-chan, good morning.

20
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,340
You're still asleep? It's Onebou-san, right?

21
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Um...

22
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,340
Do you need anything from me?

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Mikuru will help you out here from today.

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,340
So I'll say hello.

25
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Help?

26
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
Yosuke-san!

27
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,340
Hey, Haruka-chan!

28
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,340
Mikuru-chan! You're already sorry for Yosuke-san, aren't you?

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
Come out quickly!

30
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,340
I'm really sorry.

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
No, no.

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,340
Mikuru-chan is...

33
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,340
Yes?

34
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,340
I feel like I'm getting along well with the old men.

35
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,340
I feel like I'm coming to play with them.

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,340
Good morning, Haruka-chan.

37
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Good morning!

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Kawahara-kun, good morning.

39
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,340
Huh?

40
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,340
You look pale.

41
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Are you sleepy?

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
I have something to talk to you about.

43
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,340
Oh, me?

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
What is it?

45
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
I'll be right back.

46
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,340
Then let's go to my room.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Yes.

48
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,340
I'm sorry, Haruka-chan.

49
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,340
I'll be right back.

50
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,340
What's wrong?

51
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Is this room so rare?

52
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,340
Yube is indeed...

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,340
in this room.

54
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,340
Mr. Aida's speciality is just the right product.

55
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,340
It's all the same product from the sofa to the carpet.

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Well, it's impossible for him to be surprised.

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
That's not it!

58
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Yube, I saw it!

59
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Are you going to be in this room, Eri-chan?

60
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,340
I knew it.

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,340
What you were looking at...

62
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,340
You seem to have a good hobby, too.

63
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,340
That's not it!

64
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
What you're doing is...

65
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,340
I'm not making a mistake.

66
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,340
Kiba.

67
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Yes.

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
E-Eri-chan?

69
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
You guys!

70
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,340
Let go of Eri-chan right now!

71
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Stop it, Yosuke-san!

72
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Eri-chan?

73
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,340
That's why I'm telling you that I'm not making a mistake.

74
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,340
I have a debt to pay for Eri's parents.

75
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,340
I'm the one who bought it.

76
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Of course, I'll pay for it myself.

77
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
Did you get it?

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
Don't be stupid!

79
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
Let go of Eri-chan!

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,340
You still don't get it?

81
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,340
No!

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Brother!

83
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,340
That's how it is.

84
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,340
Eri is happy to see you like this in front of you.

85
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,340
You're not a woman like that, Eri.

86
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,340
I don't like it.

87
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Please forgive me.

88
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,340
I...

89
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,340
I...

90
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,340
Eri-chan...

91
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,340
Thanks to Kawahara-kun,

92
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,340
Eri's way of talking is stronger than usual.

93
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,340
Please...

94
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Please forgive me.

95
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,340
This is the main prize for this child.

96
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,340
Now, show it to Kawahara-kun yourself.

97
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,340
I'm so embarrassed.

98
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,340
How long do you want to live?

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,340
But...

100
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,340
I feel so good, Yosuke-san.

101
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,340
Can you see me?

102
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,340
Eri's heart is beating so fast.

103
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Look at me, Yosuke-san.

104
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,340
Did you get it all?

105
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,340
Yes, I did.

106
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,340
My heart is beating so fast.

107
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,340
I'm so embarrassed.

108
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,340
No, no, no.

109
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,340
I'm so angry.

110
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,340
You're all...

111
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,340
Kawahara-kun.

112
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
Eri is a woman like this,

113
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,340
but in fact, she just lost her virginity.

114
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,340
That person is...

115
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
That person is...

116
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,340
That person is...

117
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,340
That person is...

118
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,340
What did she want to say?

119
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,340
Yosuke-san.

120
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
No, what's wrong?

121
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Um, did you see Natsuki-san?

122
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Natsuki-san?

123
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Yes, I can't see her from the morning.

124
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
Natsuki-san...

125
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,340
I haven't seen her today either.

126
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,340
Is that so?

127
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,340
What's wrong?

128
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,340
No, nothing.

129
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Let's ask the director.

130
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,340
I have some business to do.

131
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,340
Please.

132
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Damn, I can't help it.

133
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,340
Yosuke-san?

134
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
Then, see you later.

135
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Yosuke-san...

136
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
He's staring at me all the time.

137
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Mikuru-chan!

138
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Haruka-chan, I like you.

139
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,340
W-What are you talking about?

140
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,340
You don't have to hide it.

141
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,340
You seem to be kind to me.

142
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Mikuru likes you too.

143
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
It's okay.

144
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,340
I won't take Mikuru.

145
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,340
No one said that.

146
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Natsuki-san?

147
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,340
I came to take a break because I have something to do.

148
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Something to do? What is it?

149
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,340
Well, I didn't ask you in detail.

150
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,340
More importantly, I came to see you.

151
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,340
What do you think?

152
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,340
Give it to me.

153
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,340
You're strong.

154
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
You know Saeko-san, don't you?

155
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Aida-san.

156
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Aida-san?

157
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Don't run away from me.

158
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,340
I'm going to call her Eri from the facility Helper.

159
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,340
You want me to be a toy?

160
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
Why are you leaving after knowing?

161
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
What do you want to do?

162
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,340
What?

163
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Aida-san and her are all related, aren't they?

164
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
That's strange.

165
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
You...

166
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,340
I just want to say that I'm crazy.

167
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,340
What?

168
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,340
I want to play with my body.

169
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,340
That's from you?

170
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,340
If you're going to lie down, you'll always lie down, right?

171
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,340
You're the same.

172
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
In the bottom of your heart,

173
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,340
the body of a woman is the only thing you want.

174
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Excuse me.

175
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,340
That's right. You're the only thing you want.

176
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,340
That's why you came here.

177
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Yes.

178
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,340
I think you did a good job.

179
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,340
It's a matter of time before you can leave.

180
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,340
You couldn't even see the reaction of the Kami village during the summer.

181
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,340
No, it's just that I'm a little tired from the cruel work.

182
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,340
I'm not as busy as I used to be.

183
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
See you later.

184
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
How long have you been like this?

185
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,340
You're late.

186
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,340
It's strange that I came here.

187
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,340
Here?

188
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
What is it?

189
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,340
You're doing it.

190
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
For me?

191
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
I'm doing it.

192
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Onii-chan!

193
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Thank you for your hard work.

194
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
No, thank you.

195
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Tomi-san!

196
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
Oh, no.

197
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Haruka-chan, it's about Natsuki-san.

198
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Is that so?

199
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,340
If that's the case, can you say something to me?

200
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,340
I think it was a request.

201
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,340
Natsuki-onee-chan said she was looking forward to working with Mikuru.

202
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
She'll come back tomorrow.

203
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,340
By the way, is Mikuru-chan staying?

204
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Onii-chan and I stayed in the room together.

205
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Mikuru-chan!

206
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,340
I decided to stay in my room.

208
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,340
Were you disappointed?

209
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Well...

210
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
Natsuki-san?

211
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
Wait a minute!

212
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,340
Natsuki-san?

213
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Where?

214
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Mikuru-chan, isn't it narrow?

215
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,340
I can sleep on the floor.

216
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,340
No, Haruka-onee-chan and I are in the same room.

217
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
It's too much.

218
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Hey! What are you doing?

219
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,340
I thought you were big.

220
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,340
Don't make fun of me.

221
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Okay.

222
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Video tape?

223
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,340
That person is...

224
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,340
It hurts!

225
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,340
That voice!

226
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,340
Natsuki-san?

227
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Natsuki-san!

228
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Hey, Onee-chan.

229
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,340
Have you ever had sex?

230
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,340
What are you saying all of a sudden?

231
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,340
I've never had sex, but I wonder if it feels good.

232
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
I don't know about that.

233
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,340
Don't say that. Go to sleep.

234
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
Mikuru-chan?

235
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,340
I feel dizzy.

236
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,340
What's wrong with me again?

237
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Mikuru-chan, I'm kidding!

238
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
Onee-chan...

239
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Actually, I just lost my husband.

240
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
The other guy...

241
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
It's a dream.

242
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,340
It wasn't a dream, was it?

243
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Oh, he was talking about me.

244
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Eri-chan.

245
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,340
It's a dream!

246
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,340
Onee-chan, you're so cute.

247
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,340
Tell me how you feel.

248
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,340
Why do I feel dizzy?

249
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,340
Onee-chan, you're the same as Mikuru-chan.

250
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,340
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,340
But don't do this!

252
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Aida, I'm talking to you!

253
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
Wh-Who are you?

254
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,340
Natsuki-san?

255
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,340
I've been waiting for you.

256
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Look, Natsuki-san.

257
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
It's you, Yosuke-san.

258
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Eri-chan, what are you doing?

259
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Natsuki-san, you don't have to touch me.

260
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,340
You're already overflowing.

261
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,340
It's only been a day since you were taken away by Yosuke-san.

262
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:28,340
Why did Eri-chan order you to do this?

263
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,340
Why did she order you to do this?

264
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,340
Natsuki-san, you're the same as me.

265
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
You're the same as me.

266
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Yosuke-san, it's not good to mess with yourself.

267
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,340
You're always overflowing.

268
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,340
You're so cute.

269
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,340
Natsuki-san, you open and close embarrassing things.

270
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,340
It's like you're having a snack.

271
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,340
Don't you think Natsuki-san is cute?

272
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,340
You think so, don't you, Yosuke-san?

273
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm telling the truth.

274
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,340
That's right. I am.

275
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,340
You don't want to be in this, do you?

276
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,340
Please, I can't stand it anymore.

277
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,340
Please, please.

278
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,340
I want to get into that.

279
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,340
I'm not going to get lost.

280
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,340
Look, this person.

281
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,340
What are you trying to hide?

282
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,340
I'm not like that.

283
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,340
Natsuki-san, you're so cute.

284
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,340
You're so cute.

285
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,340
You're so cute.

286
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,340
Please, I can't stand it anymore.

287
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,340
You're so cute.

288
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,340
I'm not going to get lost.

289
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,340
You're the same as me.

290
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
I'm scared!

291
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,840
I'm just kidding.

292
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,840
I'll stab my finger several times from the beginning.

293
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
No!

294
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,840
If it's this wet, I don't need lotion.

295
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
No!

296
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,340
It's not that fast!

297
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,840
Aina, I'm sure of it.

298
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
It's not over yet.

299
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Aina!

300
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Wow!

301
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,840
I can't believe I'm in my stomach!

302
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Why?

303
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm full!

304
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Yosuke!

305
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
I'm going too!

306
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
I'm going to seduce a woman!

307
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Wow!

308
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Mikuru, don't be like that!

309
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,340
It's too hot for me to breathe.

310
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,840
It feels good.

311
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,840
Mikuru, are you sulking?

312
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Why?

313
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Stop it already!

314
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
You're sulking too, Aina.

315
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
That's not right!

316
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
What?

317
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Aina, are you feeling good?

318
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm just kidding.

319
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
It's too hot for me to breathe.

320
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
I'm going to seduce a woman!

321
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I'm going to seduce a woman!

322
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
I'm going to seduce a woman!

323
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Mikuru, don't be like that!

324
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Mikuru, don't be like that!

325
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,340
I'm going to seduce a woman!

326
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,340
It feels so good!

327
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
I'm going to seduce a woman!

328
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Mikuru, don't be like that!

329
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Mikuru, don't be like that!

330
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,660
Hehehehe...

331
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,220
Well, you still don't have enough blood?

332
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,460
Yeah...

333
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,900
You're the reason you were so tired.

334
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,640
And you haven't had enough bile for a while, after all?

335
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
Not enough?

336
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,480
Not enough?

337
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,940
That's right.

338
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,920
I wouldn't keep doing what I really want to do.

339
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,940
Yosuke would really want to send Haruka away, wouldn't he?

340
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,840
I'm sure you want to do it with your spirit, don't you?

341
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Haruka... Haruka...

342
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,340
I'm sure he's waiting for you, Yosuke.

343
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,340
He's waiting for me?

344
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Yes, he's waiting for me.

345
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,840
I'm going to make him wet because he's bored.

346
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,840
I want you to make him feel alive.

347
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Haruka...

348
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Haruka...

349
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Why did Mikuru...

350
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
do this to me?

351
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Haruka...

352
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Yosuke?

353
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
W-What's going on at this hour?

354
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
No, don't come in!

355
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
You've been waiting for me, Haruka.

356
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
No, Yosuke!

357
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Y-You're kidding, aren't you, Yosuke?

358
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
No!

359
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
What's wrong, Yosuke?

360
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
Please, stop it!

361
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
You want me to do this to you, don't you?

362
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,840
Please, stop it!

363
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,340
I'm sure you want me to do this to you, don't you?

364
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
No!

365
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,840
I-I don't want you to do this to me!

366
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,340
Please, stop it!

367
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,840
It hurts!

368
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
It hurts!

369
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,340
Don't move!

370
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,340
It hurts!

371
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,340
It hurts!

372
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
It breaks!

373
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Please, stop it!

374
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
It hurts!

375
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Please, stop it!

376
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
If you do this to me...

377
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
It hurts!

378
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Why?

379
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
It hurts!

380
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm the one who did this.

381
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
I've been lying to you.

382
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Mikuru...

383
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Please, don't hurt me.

384
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
It hurts!

385
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
No!

386
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I'm going to be weird!

387
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
What should I do?

388
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
No!

389
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,840
I'm so embarrassed!

390
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Yosuke...

391
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
It hurts!

392
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
It hurts!

393
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
It hurts!

394
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
It hurts!

395
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
It hurts!

396
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Yosuke!

397
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
It hurts!

398
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
It hurts!

399
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
It hurts!

400
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
It hurts so much!

401
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,340
I can't stand it!

402
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,340
It hurts!

403
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,340
Please, stop it!

404
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
It hurts!

405
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,340
It hurts!

406
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,340
It hurts!

407
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
It hurts!

408
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
It hurts!

409
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
Yosuke!

410
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
It hurts!

411
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
It hurts so much!

412
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,840
It hurts.

413
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,940
It hurts!

414
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
It hurts!

415
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
It hurts!

416
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,640
It hurts!

417
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
Why is it like this again?

418
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,980
Did you understand it?

419
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
It's all my fault.

420
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Everything is in order.

421
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
That's right.

422
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,980
But this time, as planned...

423
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,980
The tiger has escaped.

424
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,980
It was faster than I thought.

425
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
Yes!

426
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
The tiger's tail was...

427
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
It was fun.

428
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,980
Please forgive me for this.

429
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
No.

430
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
It's still too early.

431
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
Please forgive me.

432
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,980
I can't take it anymore.

433
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,980
I don't want to see you again.

434
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
Please.

435
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Let's go.

436
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,980
Please forgive me.
